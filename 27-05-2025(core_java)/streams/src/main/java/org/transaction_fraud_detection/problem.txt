Problem Overview:
You are tasked with building a fraud detection system that analyzes financial transactions using Java Streams. The system will process a JSON file containing transaction records and identify suspicious patterns based on time, location, and transaction volume.

📁 Input:
A JSON file named transactions.json containing a list of transaction records. Each record includes the following fields:

transactionId (String): Unique identifier for the transaction
userId (String): Identifier of the user who made the transaction
amount (Double): Transaction amount
timestamp (String, ISO 8601 format): Date and time of the transaction (e.g., "2025-05-27T14:30:00")
location (String): City where the transaction occurred

🎯 Objectives:
✅ 1. Rapid Transaction Detection
Identify users who made more than 3 transactions within any 5-minute window.

Output the user ID and the list of transactions that occurred within that window.
✅ 2. Top 5 High-Spending Users
Determine the top 5 users who have the highest total transaction amount.

Output the user ID and their total amount spent.
✅ 3. Location-Based Anomaly Detection
Detect users who made transactions in different cities within a 10-minute window.

Output the user ID and the suspicious transaction pairs.
🧪 Output:
The program should print the results of each objective to the console in a clear and readable format.
