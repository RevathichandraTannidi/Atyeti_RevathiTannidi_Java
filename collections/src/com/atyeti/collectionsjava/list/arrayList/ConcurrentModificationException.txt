It is a runtime exception.

Thrown when a collection is modified structurally
 (e.g., add, remove) while iterating, using an iterator not designed to handle concurrent modification.
Tracked using an internal modCount in ArrayList.

Internally:
Each ArrayList has a modCount variable.

Each Iterator has its own expectedModCount.

If these donâ€™t match during iteration, a ConcurrentModificationException is thrown.

 How to Avoid ConcurrentModificationException
 1. Use Explicit Iterator with iterator.remove()
 2. Use removeIf() (Java 8+)
 3. Collect First, Then Remove
 4. Use CopyOnWriteArrayList for concurrent-safe modification
