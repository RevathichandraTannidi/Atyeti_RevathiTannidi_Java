 Problem: Business Event Scheduler with Constraints
Problem Statement:
You are managing a calendar for an international business. The company operates only on weekdays (Mondayâ€“Friday), from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM in the India Standard Time (IST) zone. You are tasked with:

âœ… Scheduling meetings by assigning the earliest available slot (of 1 hour)
âœ… Skipping weekends and non-working hours
âœ… Ensuring that no two meetings overlap
âœ… Supporting queries like:

List all meetings scheduled for a specific date

Find the next available slot

Count how many meetings are scheduled this week

ðŸ—‚ Required Concepts
ZonedDateTime, ZoneId

DayOfWeek

LocalTime, Duration

Streams for filtering

TreeMap or TreeSet for sorting

ðŸ§ª Input/Output Example:

scheduler.schedule("Quarterly Review");
scheduler.schedule("Client Sync");
scheduler.schedule("Finance Audit");

// Next available slot: 2025-06-04T11:00+05:30[Asia/Kolkata]
scheduler.listEvents(LocalDate.of(2025, 6, 4));
scheduler.countEventsThisWeek();
 Key Challenges:
You must skip weekends

You must track time within daily bounds

You must dynamically find the next working hour slot
