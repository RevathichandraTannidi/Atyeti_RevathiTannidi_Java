Objective:

Develop a robust Employee Management System (EMS) that efficiently manages employee data by leveraging file handling for data persistence, collections for in-memory data management, and exception handling for graceful error management.

üìö Functional Requirements
Employee Data Management:

Allow adding, updating, deleting, and viewing employee records.

Each record should include: Employee ID, Name, Age, Department, and Salary.

File Handling:

Persist employee data to a file (e.g., CSV or JSON) to ensure data is retained between sessions.

Implement functionalities to read from and write to the file during application start-up and shutdown.

Collections:

Utilize appropriate collection frameworks (e.g., ArrayList, HashMap) to store employee records in memory for quick access and manipulation.

Implement search and sort functionalities based on different employee attributes.

Exception Handling:

Implement comprehensive exception handling to manage scenarios such as file not found, invalid input, or data format issues.

Provide user-friendly error messages and ensure the application remains stable during exceptions.

üõ†Ô∏è Technical Specifications
Programming Language: Java

Data Storage: File system using CSV or JSON format

Collections: ArrayList for ordered storage; HashMap for quick lookup

Exception Handling: Try-catch blocks with custom exception classes where appropriate
