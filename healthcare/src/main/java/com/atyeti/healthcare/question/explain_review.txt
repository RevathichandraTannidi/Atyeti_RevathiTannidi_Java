 Smart HealthCare Appointment & Management System
Built a Spring Boot-based REST API system for booking appointments, managing medical records, and handling user roles (Admin, Doctor, Patient).
Implemented Core Java, Spring Data JPA, and MySQL with clean layered architecture.
Enabled features like doctor search by specialization, appointment approvals, and system analytics for most-booked doctors.
Tested and documented all APIs using Postman to ensure reliable request/response handling and endpoint validation.
